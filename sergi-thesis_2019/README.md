About Visualizing the Work from Sergi E. Miquel (MSc Thesis NTNU 2019):

1- Access examples folder
2- Access thesis sergi folder
3- Open html files. 
      If textures are not showing and everything is black. 
	 - Option A. A localhost needs to be set on Windows
	 - Option B. Open html with Brackets software and use the preview button (lightning top right corner)
         - Option C. Some of the examples might be soon uploaded in Vessel.js library. (https://www.vesseljs.org)
The files:
   - Case 1: Case 1 simulating the radiation problem. 
   - Side by side operation: Cases 2 to 7.
   - Simple example. Simple example displayed on the thesis. Files needs to be uploaded through the "Explore file" button. The file to upload should be "Simple_file motion.4"
   - Automatic side by side: Example with different loading conditions not included on the master thesis but developed for learning.
   - Explore file side to side: Explore file option. The motion will start displaying once the user uses the "Explore file button" and uploads the motion that corresponds to it. The file to upload is "Explore_file motion.4"
   - catenary3D: displays the example of catenary developed by the author and implemented later in the case studies. 
   - subsea2: subsea case developed
The other files are libraries that do not need to be opened. 

# vesseljs

**Vessel.js** is a JavaScript library for conceptual ship design with an object-oriented paradigm. Vessel.js represents the vessel as an object, which is used to simulate different functionalities and behaviors. Currently, the library includes methods for hydrostatic and stability calculations.

The library is developed by **Ship Design and Operation Lab** at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (**NTNU**) in Ãlesund. For documentation and other resources, visit our [wiki](https://github.com/shiplab/vesseljs/wiki).
